        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            This is a Python sample project, containing the required file structure to easily deploy to Vercel, Docker
            or Replit environments. This project uses FastAPI and MongoDB.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like the most of my projects were using this kind of
            environment and architecture I decided to put it in a public repository so everyone can enjoy and
            contribute.

            <p> - Understanding the file structure </p>
        </div>

        <p> <br>
            This project gives easier access for some of the customizations that we always need to do
            while performing deployment to the Docker, Replit or Vercel environments. But in the counter hand it came
            with routing, controllers and middleware which are commonly used in Node.js or TypeScript implementations.<br> <br> For more information about the usage of the present content:
            <a href="http://elemental.run">  Go to documentation. </a> <br>
            But first, take this advice: This project architecture was developed to delivery a great readability of the code. But it is quite confusing
            if you're not into it.
        </p>
        <div class="alertEnclosure">
            <p class="alert">So it's highly recommended <br> to start at least one project by yourself, without 
                using this
                "shortcut". </p>
        </div>


        <div class="tipNameEnclosure">
            <p> - Find out for the "new" tag </p>
        </div>

        <p>

            They are all over the place, just to help you to know what might be replaced.

            The following code shows where the "new" tag can be located:

        </p>

        <a class="prints" href="https://ibb.co/jH8vKdx"><img
                src="https://i.ibb.co/t3HMfSN/Screenshot-2023-06-18-at-19-23-49.png"
                alt="Screenshot-2023-06-18-at-19-23-49" border="0"></a>
        <p>

            These code was obtained in one of the default route files included in the project, in order to create a new
            get route we can simply get this code and replace the "new_" for "whatever_you_want". And you will have a
            basic get endpoint. But of course this is just the tip of the iceberg.
