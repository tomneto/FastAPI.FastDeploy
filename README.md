<h2>Introdution</h2>

<p class="intro">This is a Python sample project, containing the required file structure to easily deploy to Vercel, Docker or Replit environments. It is powered by FastAPI and MongoDB. The most of my projects were using this kind of environment and architecture,so I decided to put it in a public repository so everyone can enjoy and also contribute.

<p>   - Understanding the file structure </p>
</div>

<p>
    This project was created to delivery easier access for some of the customizations that we always need to do while performing deployment to the Docker, Replit or Vercel environments. But in the counter hand it came with some routing, controllers, middleware which are commonly used in Node.js or TypeScript implementations. This architecture has been developed to deliver a great readability of the code. But it is quite confusing if you're not into it.

<p class="alert">So I highly recommend to start at least one project by yourself, without using this "shortcut". </p>

<p>    - Find out for the "new" tag </p>
</div>

They are all over the place, and help you to know what might be replaced.

The following code shows where the "new" tag can be located:

These code was obtained in one of the default route files included in the project, in order to create a new get route we can simply get this code and replace the "new_" for "whatever_you_want". And you will have a basic get endpoint. But of course this is just the tip of the iceberg.
